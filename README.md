## Overview
A backend system for order lifecycle management, designed to demonstrate modular structure, clear boundaries, and explicit architectural decisions in a production-like context.

The project serves as the demonstration system for my public presentation “Architecture as Code (AaC): Automate Your Software Architecture” delivered to the DEV.BG community.

Architecture is defined and evolved using Architecture as Code (AaC) — the practice of treating software architecture as executable, version-controlled artifacts (e.g. C4 models, ADRs, rules), rather than static diagrams.

## Architectural highlights
 - Modular monolith architecture with explicitly defined module boundaries
 - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as first-class, versioned artifacts
 - Executable and documented architecture aligned with implementation
 - Designed as an evolutionary baseline for future architectural changes
